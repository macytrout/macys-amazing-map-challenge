# Map Title: Most Googled NFL Teams by State

Description:
This map visualizes the most googled NFL teams across each U.S. state based on data from Google Trends. Each state is represented by a hexagon, color-coded to indicate the most popular NFL team within that state over the last 30 days.

Design Considerations:
- Hexagonal Grid: The hexagonal map was chosen for its visually clean and consistent layout, eliminating the distortion caused by varying state sizes on traditional geographic maps.

- Color Palette: Distinct team colors were used to ensure clear identification of each team, with shades chosen to align with official team branding.

- Dark Background: A dark greige background was selected to create contrast and make the vibrant team colors pop, enhancing visual appeal.

- State Labels: Abbreviations for each state were added to improve map readability without overwhelming the design.

- Legend Placement: The legend was positioned at the top in a horizontal format for better integration into the overall layout, ensuring it doesnâ€™t interfere with the map visualization.

- Font Choices: Playfair was used for titles and captions to give the map a modern and elegant appearance, while Lato was used for in-map text for clarity and simplicity.

The goal was to create an engaging, visually appealing, and easily interpretable map that highlights regional NFL team popularity at a glance. The design balances aesthetics and functionality, ensuring the data is easy to understand while providing an appealing visual narrative.
