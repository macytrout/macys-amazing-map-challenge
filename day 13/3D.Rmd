The 3D population density map builds upon the 2D visualization by adding a vertical dimension to represent density dynamically. This approach emphasizes population density differences across Census tracts in a visually compelling way, allowing viewers to intuitively grasp the variation in density across Philadelphia. The added height provides a more engaging perspective compared to the static 2D map.

**Design Considerations**

Perspective:

- The map is rendered with a horizontal rotation (theta = 45°) and vertical tilt (phi = 45°), providing a balanced and clear perspective.

- These settings ensure that viewers can perceive the relative height differences across the city without obscuring the details.

Height Exaggeration:

- The vertical scale (scale = 350) was carefully chosen to emphasize density variations between tracts. This ensures that even smaller differences are noticeable while keeping the proportions realistic.

Shadows:

- A sun angle of 240° casts dynamic shadows, adding depth and contrast to the visualization, making it easier to distinguish between areas with similar heights.

Color Palette:

- The magma color palette, consistent with the 2D map, uses a gradient from deep purple to bright orange to reflect density values. The vibrant contrast ensures high-density areas stand out prominently.

Background:

- A clean white background was selected to minimize visual distractions and allow the map’s features to remain the focal point.

**Outcome**

The 3D map effectively highlights high-density areas such as Center City, parts of West Philadelphia, and other urban cores. The dynamic perspective draws attention to the stark contrasts between dense and sparse regions, creating a powerful tool for understanding spatial population distribution.

This visualization combines aesthetics and functionality, offering a deeper, more intuitive understanding of Philadelphia’s population density patterns. It is well-suited for presentations, reports, or engaging stakeholders in discussions about urban density and planning.
